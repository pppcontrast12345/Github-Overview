## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. GitHub hosts your code and keeps track of changes made to it using **Git**, a distributed version control system.

Key Features:
- **Version Control**: Track changes to code and manage different versions.
- **Collaboration**: Work on projects with multiple contributors, make pull requests, and review each other's work.
- **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub issues to track bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
- **Pull Requests**: Propose changes to a project, collaborate, and merge code.

## Getting Started
